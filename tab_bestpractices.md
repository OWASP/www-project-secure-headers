# Best Practices

* [Configuration proposal](#configuration-proposal)
* [Prevent information disclosure via HTTP headers](#prevent-information-disclosure-via-http-headers)
* [Prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files](#prevent-exposure-to-cross-site-scripting-when-hosting-uploaded-files)

## Configuration proposal

<!-- <div id=div-bestpractices class="ruletitle"></div> -->

Please note the best practices below suggest methods to change web server configuration to add headers. Security headers can also be successfully added to your application at the software level as well in almost every web language. Many web frameworks add some of these headers automatically.

The following section proposes a configuration for the [actively supported and working draft security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-headers).

üí° Additional information about HTTP security headers on [OpenCRE](https://opencre.org/cre/636-347?name=OWASP+Secure+Headers+Project&section=configuration&link=https%3A%2F%2Fowasp.org%2Fwww-project-secure-headers%2F%23div-bestpractices).

### Proposed values

‚ö†Ô∏è The `Pragma` header is only specified for backwards compatibility with the HTTP/1.0 caches.

üí° Content of the table below is also provided, as JSON, via this [file](ci/headers_add.json) (automatically updated).

| Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy                   | `same-origin`   |
| Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy                 | `same-origin`  |

## Prevent information disclosure via HTTP headers

<!-- <div id=div-bestpractices class="ruletitle"></div> -->

This section provides a collection of HTTP response headers to remove, when possible, from any HTTP response to prevent any [disclosure of technical information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) about environment. The following list of headers can be used to configure a [reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/) or a [web application firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall) to handle removal operation of the mentioned headers.

üí° Additional information about technical information disclosure in HTTP header on [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/403-005?name=OWASP+Secure+Headers+Project&section=Prevent+information+disclosure+via+HTTP+headers&link=https%3A%2F%2Fowasp.org%2Fwww-project-secure-headers%2F%23div-bestpractices_prevent-information-disclosure-via-http-headers).

üí° When an HTTP response header is known by the analytics site [WebTechSurvey](https://webtechsurvey.com/), then, a reference link is added to its usage statistics page. Otherwise, a reference link regarding the documentation of the header is provided.

üí° Content of the table below is also provided, as JSON, via this [file](ci/headers_remove.json) (automatically updated).

## Prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files

This section describes, how the HTTP response header named [Content-Disposition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition), can be used to prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files and opening them in the same web browsing context than the application.

It can happen a case in which an application allows a user to upload a file and then allow this file to be accessed by other users. If such feature allows uploading of HTML files (also apply for [SVG file](http://ghostlulz.com/xss-svg/)) then it can be used, as a vector, to store an HTML file containing JavaScript code. Therefore, the feature become prone to [stored cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability.

To prevent this exposure, the HTTP response header named [Content-Disposition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition), can be used with the following value to instruct browsers to download the file instead of open it in the same web browsing context than the application:

```
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="myfile.html"
```
