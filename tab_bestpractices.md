# Best Practices

* [Configuration proposal](#configuration-proposal)
* [Prevent information disclosure via HTTP headers](#prevent-information-disclosure-via-http-headers)
* [Prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files](#prevent-exposure-to-cross-site-scripting-when-hosting-uploaded-files)

* [Quickly check security HTTP headers for applications exposed internally](#quickly-check-security-http-headers-for-applications-exposed-internally)

## Configuration proposal

Please note the best practices below suggest methods to change web server configuration to add headers. Security headers can also be successfully added to your application at the software level as well in almost every web language. Many web frameworks add some of these headers automatically.

The following section proposes a configuration for the [actively supported and working draft security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-headers).

### Proposed values

‚ö†Ô∏è The `Pragma` header is only specified for backwards compatibility with the HTTP/1.0 caches.

üí° Content of the table below is also provided, as JSON, via this [file](ci/headers_add.json) (automatically updated).

<!-- HEADERS_ADD_TABLE_START -->

| Header name                                  | Proposed value  |
| ---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Strict-Transport-Security                    | `max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains` |
| X-Frame-Options                              | `deny` |
| X-Content-Type-Options                       | `nosniff` |
| Content-Security-Policy                      | `default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content` |
| X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies            | `none` |
| Referrer-Policy                              | `no-referrer`  |
| Clear-Site-Data                              | `"cache","cookies","storage"` |
| Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy                 | `require-corp`   |
| Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy                   | `same-origin`   |
| Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy                 | `same-origin`  |
| Permissions-Policy                           | `accelerometer=(),ambient-light-sensor=(),autoplay=(),battery=(),camera=(),display-capture=(),document-domain=(),encrypted-media=(),fullscreen=(),gamepad=(),geolocation=(),gyroscope=(),layout-animations=(self),legacy-image-formats=(self),magnetometer=(),microphone=(),midi=(),oversized-images=(self),payment=(),picture-in-picture=(),publickey-credentials-get=(),speaker-selection=(),sync-xhr=(self),unoptimized-images=(self),unsized-media=(self),usb=(),screen-wake-lock=(),web-share=(),xr-spatial-tracking=()` |
| Cache-Control         | `no-store, max-age=0`  |
| Pragma         | `no-cache`  |

### Web server syntax

This section indicates the syntax to use to set an HTTP header according to the web server targeted.

| Web server name | Syntax  |
| ----------------|---------|
| Apache          | `Header always set [HEADER_NAME] [PROPOSED_VALUE]` |
| Nginx           | `add_header [HEADER_NAME] [PROPOSED_VALUE] always;` |
| Lighttpd        | `setenv.add-response-header = ("[HEADER_NAME]" => "[PROPOSED_VALUE]")` |
| IIS             | Refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/httpprotocol/customheaders/). |

## Quickly check security HTTP headers for applications exposed on the Internet

The online tool [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com) can be used to achieve that objective.

It returns the grade in the following HTTP response headers:

* **x-score**: Contains a Base64 encoded JSON object with the grade letter and its associated color name.
* **x-grade**: Contains the grade letter.

```shell
$ curl -v "https://securityheaders.com/?hide=on&followRedirects=on&q=https://mozilla.org"
> Trying 104.21.70.128:443...
> Connected to securityheaders.com (104.21.70.128) port 443
> ...
< HTTP/2 200
< date: Tue, 02 Mar 2021 17:29:23 GMT
< content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< vary: Accept-Encoding
< x-score: eyJzY29yZSI6IkEiLCAiY29sb3VyIjoiZ3JlZW4ifQ==
< x-grade: A
< ...
```

Content of the **x-score** header value:

```shell
$ echo eyJzY29yZSI6IkEiLCAiY29sb3VyIjoiZ3JlZW4ifQ== | base64 -d
{"score":"A", "colour":"green"}
```

## Quickly check security HTTP headers for applications exposed internally

The portable cross-platform tool [Venom](https://github.com/ovh/venom) with the dedicated [OSHP Validator test suites aligned with the OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator).

Use the following example set of commands:

```shell
# Get Venom binary file from 
# https://github.com/ovh/venom/releases
# Get the YAML test suites from
# check out project https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator
# Read the README.md, additional demonstration about usage available on
# https://gist.github.com/righettod/f63548ebd96bed82269dcc3dfea27056#gistcomment-3630811
$ venom run --var="target_site=https://mozilla.org" --var="logout_url=/logout" tests_suite.yml

## Prevent information disclosure via HTTP headers

This section provides a collection of HTTP response headers to remove, when possible, from any HTTP response to prevent any [disclosure of technical information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) about environment. The following list of headers can be used to configure a [reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/) or a [web application firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall) to handle removal operation of the mentioned headers.

## Prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files

This section describes, how the HTTP response header named [Content-Disposition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition), can be used to prevent exposure to cross-site scripting when hosting uploaded files and opening them in the same web browsing context than the application.

It can happen a case in which an application allows a user to upload a file and then allow this file to be accessed by other users. If such feature allows uploading of HTML files (also apply for [SVG file](http://ghostlulz.com/xss-svg/)) then it can be used, as a vector, to store an HTML file containing JavaScript code. Therefore, the feature become prone to [stored cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability.

To prevent this exposure, the HTTP response header named [Content-Disposition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition), can be used with the following value to instruct browsers to download the file instead of open it in the same web browsing context than the application:

```
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="myfile.html"
```
