## Analysis Tools

### hsecscan

### headers

Python script to get some response headers from Alexa top sites files and store in a MySQL database.

**GitHub:** <https://github.com/oshp/headers/>

### SecurityHeaders.com

There are services out there that will analyze the HTTP response headers of other sites but I also wanted to add a rating system to the results. The HTTP response headers that this site analysis provides huge levels of protection and it's important that sites deploy them. Hopefully, by providing an easy mechanism to assess them, and further information on how to deploy missing headers, we can drive up the usage of security based headers across the web.

## Miscellaneous Hints

### Convert a Permissions-Policy back to Feature-Policy

As the [Permissions-Policy](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/permissions-policy-explainer.md) header is still in development and is [not yet well supported](https://caniuse.com/permissions-policy), it can be interesting to use the two formats to increase the coverage of browsers according to their support level for **Permissions-Policy** and **[Feature-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy)** policy headers.

The following _python3_ code snippet can be useful to achieve such conversion.

ðŸ“‘ Source for the conversion rules was this [one](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/permissions-policy-explainer.md#appendix-big-changes-since-this-was-called-feature-policy).

ðŸ’» Code snippet:

```python
permissions_policy = 'fullscreen=(), geolocation=(self "https://game.com" "https://map.example.com"), gyroscope=(self), usb=*'
feature_policy_directives = []
# Collect directives
permissions_policy_directives = permissions_policy.split(",")
# Process each directive
for permissions_policy_directive in permissions_policy_directives:
    # Remove leading and trailing spaces
    directive = permissions_policy_directive.strip(" ")
    # Remove all double quotes
    directive = directive.replace("\"", "")
    # Replace disabling expression () by the corresponding one in Feature-Policy
    directive = directive.replace("()", "'none'")
    # Quote keywords: self
    directive = directive.replace("self", "'self'")
    # Replace the equals affectation character by a space
    directive = directive.replace("=", " ")
    # Remove parenthesis
    directive = directive.replace("(", "").replace(")", "")
    # Add the current directive to the collection
    feature_policy_directives.append(directive)
# Convert the collection of directives to a string with ; as directives separator
feature_policy = "; ".join(feature_policy_directives)
print(feature_policy)
```

ðŸ’» Execution example:

```shell
$ python code.py
fullscreen 'none'; geolocation 'self' https://game.com https://map.example.com; gyroscope 'self'; usb *
```

### Test locally a Content-Security-Policy for weaknesses

It can be interesting to validate locally a **Content-Security-Policy** for presence of weaknesses prior to apply it on deployed web applications.

The following _JavaScript_ code snippet can be useful to achieve such validation by leveraging the [csp-evaluator](https://github.com/google/csp-evaluator) NPM module provided by Google.

ðŸ’» Code snippet:

```javascript
import {CspEvaluator} from "csp_evaluator/dist/evaluator.js";
import {CspParser} from "csp_evaluator/dist/parser.js";

const args = process.argv.slice(2)
if(args.length == 0){
    console.error("[!] Missing CSP!");
}else{
    const csp = args[0]
    console.info(`[+] CSP to evaluate:\n${csp}`);
    const parsed = new CspParser(csp).csp;
    console.info(`[+] Evaluation results:`);
    const results = new CspEvaluator(parsed).evaluate();
    results.forEach(elt => {
        let info = `[Directive '${elt.directive}' - Severity ${elt.severity}]: ${elt.description}`;
        console.info(info);
    });
}
```

ðŸ’» Execution example:

```shell
$ node code.js "default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content"
[+] CSP to evaluate:
default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content
[+] Evaluation results:
[Directive 'default-src' - Severity 50]: 'self' can be problematic if you host JSONP, Angular or user uploaded files.
```
