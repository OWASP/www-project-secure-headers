# Technical Resources

This section covers a list of tools to analyze, develop and administrate HTTP secure headers to help achieve more secure and trustworthy web systems.

## Analysis Tools

### hsecscan

A security scanner for HTTP response headers.

**Github:** <https://github.com/riramar/hsecscan>

### headers

Python script to get some response headers from Alexa top sites file and store in a MySQL database.

**Github:** <https://github.com/oshp/headers/>

### SecurityHeaders.com

There are services out there that will analyse the HTTP response headers of other sites but I also wanted to add a rating system to the results. The HTTP response headers that this site analyses provide huge levels of protection and it's important that sites deploy them. Hopefully, by providing an easy mechanism to assess them, and further information on how to deploy missing headers, we can drive up the usage of security based headers across the web.
