🎯 The **OWASP Secure Headers Project** (also called **OSHP**) describes HTTP response headers that your application can use to increase the security of your application. Once set, these HTTP response headers can restrict modern browsers from running into easily preventable vulnerabilities. The OWASP Secure Headers Project intends to raise awareness and use of these headers.

HTTP headers are well known and also despised. Seeking a balance between usability and security, developers implement functionality through the headers that can make applications more versatile or secure. But in practice how are the headers being implemented? What sites follow the best implementation practices? Big companies, small, all or none?

## Description

📚 The OWASP Secure Headers Project aim to provide elements about the following aspects regarding HTTP security headers:

* [Guidance](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-headers) about the recommended HTTP security headers that can be leveraged.
* [Guidance](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-bestpractices) about the HTTP headers that should be removed.
* [Tools](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-technical) to validate an HTTP security header configuration.
* [Code](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-technical) libraries that can be leveraged to configure recommended HTTP security headers.
* [Statistics](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-stats) about usage of the recommended HTTP security headers.
* [REST API](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-tracking/issues/2) allowing to obtain the recommended configuration for different web server.

🏭 All the tools provided by the OSHP are gathered under this [GitHub organization](https://github.com/oshp/).

📡 A presentation of the project is available on the [OWASP Spotlight Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4F3VWQYU9E) as well as on the [Application Security Podcast Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SNU9clVhKU).

## Migration

🌎 The OWASP Secure Headers Project was migrated from the [old website](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project) to the [GitHub OWASP organization](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-secure-headers).

📦 The following projects are now **archived**, they are initiatives that are now replaced by new projects:

* [headers](https://github.com/oshp/headers).
* [headers-ui-container](https://github.com/oshp/headers-ui-container).

## Security headers usage statistics

📈 We provide statistics, updated every month, about HTTP response security headers usage mentioned by the OWASP Secure Headers Project.

They are available through [this GitHub project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-stats).

## Security headers usage validator

✅ We provide a [venom](https://github.com/ovh/venom) tests suite to validate an HTTP security response header configuration against OWASP Secure Headers Project recommendation.

It is available through [this GitHub project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator).

## Headers reference files

As mentioned in previous sections, we provide the collection of HTTP response security headers to add as well as HTTP response headers to remove, both in table form.

💡 Additionally, we provide this information as two JSON files to enable automation in the context of a provisioning workflow:

* Collection of [HTTP response security headers to add](ci/headers_add.json).
* Collection of [HTTP response headers to remove](ci/headers_remove.json).

📡 These json files are automatically updated.

## Technical references health dashboard

👁‍🗨 We automatically generate and monitor this **[dashboard](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-secure-headers/blob/master/monitoring_technical_references_dashboard.md)** to identify any dead project referenced in the **[Technical Resources](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-technical)** tab.

## Discussions, information and roadmap

💬 We use the GitHub [discussions feature](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-tracking/discussions) for discussions about the project as well as spreading global information about it.

👩‍💻 The work on the OSHP projects and associated components is tracked using the GitHub [project feature](https://github.com/orgs/oshp/projects/2).
