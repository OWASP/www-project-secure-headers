The OWASP Secure Headers Project (also called OSHP) describes HTTP response headers that your application can use to increase the security of your application. Once set, these HTTP response headers can restrict modern browsers from running into easily preventable vulnerabilities. The OWASP Secure Headers Project intends to raise awareness and use of these headers.

## Introduction

HTTP headers are well-known and also despised. Seeking a balance between usability and security, developers implement functionality through the headers that can make applications more versatile or secure. But in practice how are the headers being implemented? What sites follow the best implementation practices? Big companies, small, all or none?

## Description

We aim to publish reports on header usage stats, developments and changes, code libraries that make these headers easily accessible to developers on a range of platforms, and data sets concerning the general usage of these headers.

## Migration

The OWASP Secure Headers Project was migrated from the [old website](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project) to the [GitHub OWASP organization](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-secure-headers).

## Security headers usage statistics

We provide statistics, updated every month, about HTTP response security headers usage mentioned by the OWASP Secure Headers Project.

They are available through [this GitHub project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-stats).

## Discussions and information

We use the GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-secure-headers/discussions) area for discussions about the project as well as spreading global information about it.
