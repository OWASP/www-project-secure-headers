## Convert a Permissions-Policy back to Feature-Policy

As the [Permissions-Policy](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/permissions-policy-explainer.md) header is still in development and is [not yet well supported](https://caniuse.com/permissions-policy), it can be interesting to use the two formats to increase the coverage of browsers according to their support level for **Permissions-Policy** and **[Feature-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy)** policy headers.

The following _python3_ code snippet can be useful to achieve such conversion.

📑 Source for the conversion rules was this [one](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/permissions-policy-explainer.md#appendix-big-changes-since-this-was-called-feature-policy).

💻 Code snippet:

```python
permissions_policy = 'fullscreen=(), geolocation=(self "https://game.com" "https://map.example.com"), gyroscope=(self), usb=*'
feature_policy_directives = []
# Collect directives
permissions_policy_directives = permissions_policy.split(",")
# Process each directive
for permissions_policy_directive in permissions_policy_directives:
    # Remove leading and trailing spaces
    directive = permissions_policy_directive.strip(" ")
    # Remove all double quotes
    directive = directive.replace("\"", "")
    # Replace disabling expression () by the corresponding one in Feature-Policy
    directive = directive.replace("()", "'none'")
    # Quote keywords: self
    directive = directive.replace("self", "'self'")
    # Replace the equals affectation character by a space
    directive = directive.replace("=", " ")
    # Remove parenthesis
    directive = directive.replace("(", "").replace(")", "")
    # Add the current directive to the collection
    feature_policy_directives.append(directive)
# Convert the collection of directives to a string with ; as directives separator
feature_policy = "; ".join(feature_policy_directives)
print(feature_policy)
```

💻 Execution example:

```shell
$ python code.py
fullscreen 'none'; geolocation 'self' https://game.com https://map.example.com; gyroscope 'self'; usb *
```

## Test locally a Content-Security-Policy for weaknesses

It can be interesting to validate locally a **Content-Security-Policy** for presence of weaknesses prior to apply it on deployed web applications.

The following _JavaScript_ code snippet can be useful to achieve such validation by leveraging the [csp-evaluator](https://github.com/google/csp-evaluator) NPM module provided by Google.

💻 Code snippet:

```javascript
import {CspEvaluator} from "csp_evaluator/dist/evaluator.js";
import {CspParser} from "csp_evaluator/dist/parser.js";

const args = process.argv.slice(2)
if(args.length == 0){
    console.error("[!] Missing CSP!");
}else{
    const csp = args[0]
    console.info(`[+] CSP to evaluate:\n${csp}`);
    const parsed = new CspParser(csp).csp;
    console.info(`[+] Evaluation results:`);
    const results = new CspEvaluator(parsed).evaluate();
    results.forEach(elt => {
        let info = `[Directive '${elt.directive}' - Severity ${elt.severity}]: ${elt.description}`;
        console.info(info);
    });
}
```

💻 Execution example:

```shell
$ node code.js "default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests"
[+] CSP to evaluate:
default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests
[+] Evaluation results:
[Directive 'default-src' - Severity 50]: 'self' can be problematic if you host JSONP, Angular or user uploaded files.
```

## Generate configuration code using the OSHP headers reference files

The following _bash_ code snippet, leveraging [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), can be used to generate configuration code using the OSHP headers reference files.

💻 Code snippet and execution example:

```shell
# Generate the Nginx collection of instructions to add the recommended HTTP response headers
$ curl -sk https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/ci/headers_add.json | jq -r '.headers[] | "add_header \(.name) \(.value);"'
add_header Cache-Control no-store, max-age=0;
add_header Clear-Site-Data "cache","cookies","storage";
add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy require-corp;
...
```

## Quickly check security HTTP headers

The portable cross-platform tool [Venom](https://github.com/ovh/venom) with the dedicated [OSHP Validator test suites aligned with the OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator) can be used.

💻 Use the following example set of commands:

```shell
$ venom run --var="target_site=https://mozilla.org" --var="logout_url=/logout" tests_suite.yml

        [info] This header was split into Permissions-Policy and Document-Policy and will be considered deprecated once all impacted features are moved off of feature policy.
    • Public-Key-Pins SUCCESS
        [info] This header has been deprecated by all major browsers and is no longer recommended. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible!
    • Expect-CT SUCCESS
        [info] This header will likely become obsolete in June 2021. Since May 2018 new certificates are expected to support SCTs by default. Certificates before March 2018 were allowed to have a lifetime of 39 months, those will all be expired in June 2021.
    • X-Xss-Protection SUCCESS
        [info] The X-XSS-Protection header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side.
```

## Syntax for adding HTTP response headers on different web or application servers

Use the following steps to leverage an "LLM as a Service" (LLMaaS) to generate corresponding configuration code snippet for the wanted web or application server:

1. Download this [file](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/ci/headers_add.json).
2. Join the json file above to the chat.
3. Use this user prompt in the chat to ask the generation:

```text
Generate a configuration code snippet to set HTTP response security headers for the '[TARGET_APPLICATION_OR_WEB_SERVER_NAME]'. Use only the information from the json file attached. Only provide the configuration code snippet. The configuration must overwrite any existing value for an HTTP response security header present into the json file attached.
```

🔬 The user prompt proposed was tested against [Google GEMINI](https://gemini.google.com/) model **2.5 Flash** and the generated configuration code was submitted to [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) model **ChatGPT** to indicates if it was valid for the intended web or application server. The following value for the `[TARGET_APPLICATION_OR_WEB_SERVER_NAME]` placeholder were used:

* `apache web server`.
* `nginx web server`.
* `lighttpd web server`.
* `litespeed web server`
* `caddy web server`
* `iis web server`
